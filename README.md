STRENGTHENING SECURITY IN SMART CITIES AND IMPLEMENTING ANOMALY DETECTION AND ELIMINATING MALICIOUS NODE

The integration of Bit Coin technology within smart city landscapes has raise apprehension about efficient misuse for illicit activities. While Block Chain technology inherently secures transactions, it lacks the capacity for direct detection of illegal activities. Anomaly detection serves as a pivotal method in recognizing fraudulent transactions. Previous approaches, like heuristic and signature-based methods, were insufficient in comprehensively addressing anomaly detection complexity. However, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) presents a promising avenue to effectively identify patterns in Bit Coin transactions. This proposed method explores the use of ensemble learning to detect anomalies in Bit Coin, utilizing a model that combines multiple ML classifiers. The model incorporates the Machine Learning methodology for data balancing and employs malicious node detection and elimination techniques for refining performance and strengthening security for future. The stacking model integrates various classifiers, while interpreting the model's predictions, offering insights into the decision-making process thus blocking the future malicious node detection. This approach significantly fortifies security in smart cities, proactively addressing potential malicious nodes within the Bit Coin network. It represents a refined and nuanced strategy, enhancing the resilience of smart city infrastructures against illicit activities associated with Bit Coin transactions.
